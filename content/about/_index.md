<a href="jmp.pdf" target="_blank">Freight in the Time of Covid: A Model of US Trucking</a>

Trade models typically ignore the freight transportation industry. I develop a model of the US trucking industry that can replicate several stylized facts that I document, including inversely and spatially correlated transport prices, while remaining tractable enough to be embedded within a trade model and quantified using market-level data. Rather than being treated as fixed and exogenous, trade costs emerge endogenously as the market-clearing prices of the freight transportation industry. I quantify driver supply using instruments based on Covid-era shocks to US container import quantities. Finally, I use a simple calibration of my spatial model to estimate how changes in freight transportation prices affected goods prices and consumer welfare following the onset of Covid, and I find that changes in transport markets were primarily demand-driven.
