**Freight in the Time of Covid: Quantifying A Model of US Trucking** <br>
(Job Market Paper; working paper coming soon)

Trade models typically ignore the freight transportation industry. I develop a model of the US trucking industry that can replicate several stylized facts that I document, including the return-trip effect and spatial correlations in transportation prices, while remaining tractable enough to be embedded within a trade model and quantified using market-level data. Rather than being treated as fixed and exogenous, trade costs emerge endogenously as the market-clearing prices of the freight transportation industry. I quantify my model's key parameters using instruments based on Covid-era shocks to US container import quantities. Finally, I use a simple calibration of my spatial model to estimate how changes in freight transportation prices affected goods prices and consumer welfare following the onset of Covid.
